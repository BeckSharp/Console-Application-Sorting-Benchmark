# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark
### Purpose of the application:
The purpose of this application is to compare the runtime speeds of sorting algorithms, when sorting an array of data.

The application does this by randomly generating an array of 10000 integers, and timing how long it takes for each sorting algorithm to sort the array. The results are then printed on the console.
### Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
 1. Quick sort
 2. Merge sort
 3. Bubble sort
 4. Insertion sort
 5. Selection sort

### Code Features:
 - Delegates
 - 5 Sorting Algorithms
 - System.Diagnostics Namespace

### Example Console Output:
```
Quick sort      = 00:00:00.0019991 seconds
Merge sort      = 00:00:00.0208417 seconds
Bubble sort     = 00:00:00.5668648 seconds
Insertion sort  = 00:00:00.2892120 seconds
Selection sort  = 00:00:00.1884969 seconds
```
